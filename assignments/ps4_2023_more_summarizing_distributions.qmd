*\textsc{Note}: Start with the file `ps4_2023_more_summarizing_distributions.qmd` (available from the github repository at <https://github.com/UChicago-pol-methods/IntroQSS-F23/tree/main/assignments>). Modify that file to include your answers. Make sure you can "render" the file (e.g. in RStudio by clicking on the `Render` button). Submit both the qmd file and the PDF via Canvas.* 



The entire problem set refers to the following joint distribution of two random variables $X$ and $Y$: 

$$
f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
1/2  & x = 0, y = 0 \\
1/6 & x = 1, y = 0 \\
1/3 & x = 1, y = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**Part 1: Covariance and correlation**

(1a) Compute the covariance of $X$ and $Y$. Show your work. 


(1b) Compute the correlation of $X$ and $Y$. Show your work. (There is no need to repeat calculations from (1a).)

(1c)  Write a function that takes as arguments `x` (a vector of possible values of a random variable $X$), `y` (a vector of possible values of a random variable $Y$), and `fxy` (a vector of frequencies  $f(x, y)$ for each combination of $x$ and $y$) and returns $\text{Cov}[X, Y]$. Use it to confirm the covariance calculation you did above.  

```{r}
# your code here
```

(1d) Write a function with the same arguments that computes correlation between two random variables $X$ and $Y$. Use it to confirm the correlation calculation you did above.

```{r}
# your code here 

```



**Part 2: Conditional expectations, LIE, and BLP**

(2a) What is $E[Y \mid X = 0]$? What is $E[Y \mid X = 1]$?


(2b) Show that $E[Y] = E[E[Y \mid X]]$, i.e. that the law of iterated expectations holds in this case.

(2c) What is the best linear predictor (BLP) of $Y$ given $X$? Express your answer in terms of an intercept $\alpha$ and a slope $\beta$.

(2d) How close does the BLP of $Y$ given $X$ come to the conditional expectation function (CEF) of $Y$ given $X$?


**Part 3: Law of total variance**

(3a) What is $V[Y \mid X = 0]$? What is $V[Y \mid X = 1]$? 

(3b) Compute the two components of the Law of Total Variance (i.e. Eve's law) and confirm that they add up to $V[Y]$.
