# Welcome! 

## This course

- Instructor: Andy Eggers
- Teaching assistant: Moksha Sharma
- part of a sequence:
  - Intro to Quant Soc Sci **(this course)** (fall)
  - Causal Inference (winter)
  - Linear Models (spring)


## Our objectives 

- give a strong foundation for further study
- give a taste of what is fun about quantitative social science 
    - working with data, visualizing relationships
    - mathematical rigor and clarity
    - thinking about causality and identification

. . .

Five modules:

- Probability (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2)
- Summarizing distributions (3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2)
- Estimation (5.1, 5.2, 6.1)
- Inference (6.2, 7.1, 7.2)
- Regression (8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2)


## Expectations about background

Useful (not required) to have exposure to

- math (semi-recently)
- probability & statistics
- econometrics/regression modeling
- programming

. . .

If you have don't have much exposure to $X$, you may have to work harder on $X$.

If you have lots of exposure to all of the above, we hope you can still learn something.


## Expectations for the course {.smaller}

- Read the syllabus
- Prepare for class: attempt the main reading (usually Aronow & Miller); start with an easier reading if necessary 
- If you are stuck on reading/assignments: 
    1. Use google first, or e.g. ChatGPT
    1. Ask your question on our private StackOverflow (https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/uchicagopolmeth)
    1. Or if you're brave, ask on the real StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) if it's about `R` or CrossValidated (https://stats.stackexchange.com/) if it's about stats. 
- If you are confused in class, ask a question

. . .

Please also *answer* questions on our private StackOverflow.

If you email me a question, I am likely to tell you to put it on our StackOverflow.


## Labs 

Fridays, Cobb 301.

- Lab 1: 12:30-1:20
- Lab 2: ???


## Assessment 

- 40% problem sets (8 in all)
- 10% class participation
- 20% in-class midterm on ???
- 30% final take-home exam


## Technical setup

By lab on Friday (ideally sooner), make sure you do this:

1. install `R` from https://cran.rstudio.com/ 
1. Install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
1. In RStudio install `tidyverse` and `tinytex`

If you run into trouble, use (free) RStudio Cloud until you resolve the issue.


# Motivation


## What most applied social scientists "know" about statistics

Most social scientists "know" a few things about

- Linear regression (OLS) and two other estimation techniques (logit, probit)
- **Statistical inference** (standard errors, p-values, null hypothesis)

. . .

That's it.

## What most applied social scientists "know" about linear regression (OLS) {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- We use **regression** (ordinary least squares, OLS) to measure relationships between a **dependent variable** (DV, left-hand-side (LHS) variable, outcome variable) $Y$ and **independent variables** (right-hand-side (RHS) variables, covariates, predictors) $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, etc
- We call the estimated "effect" of each variable a regression **coefficient**
- [For regression to work, you need a lot of assumptions,]{.orange} e.g. [relationships have to be linear]{.red}, [the error term (or the dependent variable) needs to be normally distributed]{.red} 
- A regression coefficient for $X_1$ measures how much $Y$ is predicted to change with a **one-unit increase** in $X_1$, holding fixed $X_2$, $X_3$, etc 
- Sometimes this coefficient is a good estimate of the **(causal) effect** of $X_1$ on $Y$, i.e. what would happen if you changed $X_1$
- You can use an **interaction term** to get a coefficient that measures how the "effect" of $X_1$ depends on the value of $X_2$

## What most applied social scientists "know" about other estimation techniques

:::{.incremental}

- When the dependent variable is **binary** (i.e. only 0 or 1), you [shouldn't use OLS]{.orange} 
- Instead you should use **logit** or **probit**
- Logit and probit coefficients are hard to understand

:::

## What most applied social scientists "know" about statistical inference {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Statistical software gives you a **standard error** for each regression coefficient. A bigger standard error means we are more uncertain what that coefficient really is.
- The **null hypothesis** is usually the claim that there is no relationship. We do **hypothesis testing** to see if we can reject the null hypothesis. 
- If the **p-value** on your coefficient is below .05, your coefficient is **statistically significant** and you can **reject the null hypothesis**. This means [the coefficient probably isn't zero]{.orange} because [the relationship is unlikely to have occurred by chance]{.red}. If you get a p-value above .05, [you didn't find anything]{.red} and [your analysis didn't work]{.red}. 

:::

## What we want you to know 

You need to know what is above -- at least, the correct parts! (e.g. reading regression table, interpreting interaction terms) 

. . .

But also, we want you 

- to avoid the misconceptions (the stuff in [orange]{.orange} and [red]{.red})
- to understand common approaches to uncertainty (e.g. standard errors) and hypothesis testing (e.g. p-values): the logic behind these approaches and their limits.
- to see what urn problems have to do with social science.

::: {.notes}
You might decide that standard errors and hypothesis testing aren't for you!
